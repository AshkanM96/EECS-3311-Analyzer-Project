## EECS-3311-Analyzer-Project

This is just a repository of an Advanced Calculator application written in *Eiffel* that does not support Floats, Power, and Trigonometry but supports Set operations through multiple software design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Composite, Command, Observer, Lazy Initialization, and Visitor).

Furthermore, since a fully general expression tree has been designed and implemented, the application can support other notations (i.e., infix and postfix) with minimal change.
